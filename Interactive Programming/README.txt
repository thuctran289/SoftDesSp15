3/11/14 - LEDraw - Software Design 
LEDraw was created by Thuc Tran and Shane Kelly, but you are free to borrow the code and make other awesome things as long as you show us the cool product!

Steps to use:
1. Install OpenCV at opencv.org
2. Compile the code in a Python compiler
3. Grab an LED and start drawing!
	TIP: You can change the color masking of the object that you want to draw with (if you don't want to use a white LED like we did). You can change it by changing the 'lower_BGR' and 'upper_BGR' variables.
4. As you move your 'pen' around, you will leave a drawing trail.
5. The color is decided by what the average pixel color is in the red box in the bottom left hand corner. Take a real-life object and put it in front of the camera in order to draw with that object's color!
6. The pen size can be changed by drawing in the '+' and '-' boxes in the bottom right.
7. The screen can be cleared by drawing in the 'R' box in the bottom right.
