1. What is the general trend in the curve?
	In general, it is increasing. As we increase the percentage of the data as training data, we get more generally more accurate predictions. 
2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others?  Why?
	No particular part of the curve stands out as being much nosier than other parts. It appears uniformly noisy across the line. If I had to guess why, it would be due to the variance occuring uniformly across different digits. 
3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
	It depends on a definition of smoothness, but it does get much smoother as you increase the number of trials. I would guess that for a very smooth line, at least a hundred trials were needed. However, this still does not generate a strictly increasing line. More generally, having 10-15 trials will probably be sufficient for a smooth line. 
4. Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10**-10)).  What happens?  If you want to know why this happens, see this Wikipedia page as well as the documentation for LogisticRegression in scikit-learn.
	A substantially larger C (C == 10^10) will take much longer to generate a model. However, the accuracy for the data seems to be much higher at across all percentages. In particular, using 5% of the data with this value appears to be more accurate than using 90% with a C == 10^-10. Conversely, using a smaller C (C==10^-50), the accuracy is uniformly worse than the larger values of C, and does not have its accuracy scale with more data.
